              <hr>
              QuizLite is an innovative productivity tool I developed to help students effectively manage their academic tasks while enhancing their study habits. In this project, I took on the roles of backend, frontend, and UI/UX designer. I created a fully responsive platform where users can organize their schedules, create personalized flashcards, and test their knowledge through quizzes. <br><br> I implemented features such as task management, progress tracking, and interactive quiz creation, all designed to optimize the student learning experience. Through this project, I sharpened my skills in full-stack web development, database management, and user experience design, learning the importance of building intuitive interfaces and robust backend systems that cater to the needs of users.

I carefully crafted layouts and interactions to ensure ease of use and accessibility. <br><br> The project emphasized collaborative tools, task management, and content sharing, making it ideal for users looking to balance creativity with productivity. This project allowed me to dive deep into user-centered design principles, making sure that the final product aligned with both the needs of the users and the aesthetic values of the platform. Through CreateSpace, I gained a better understanding of how to design systems that cater to both individual and group workflows in a seamless manner.

              As an IT intern at Chimes Consulting, I had the invaluable opportunity to contribute to two significant projects: the Chimes Consulting Website ReVamped and the Marcburg Website. My role as both a web frontend and backend tester, as well as a UI/UX designer, involved collaborating closely with developers and designers to ensure the functionality, performance, and user experience of both websites met the highest standards. I conducted thorough testing on the frontend elements, identifying and troubleshooting usability issues while providing valuable feedback to enhance the user interface. <br><br> Additionally, I was involved in backend testing, ensuring that the integration between the website's design and its technical infrastructure was seamless. This internship allowed me to apply my academic knowledge to real-world challenges, further developing my skills in web development, user interface design, and testing. It also gave me a deeper understanding of the web consulting process, from client needs to product delivery, reinforcing my passion for problem-solving and innovative design.
